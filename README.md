# kernel-skills

**kernel-skills** is an open source library of high quality skill files for AI coding agents working on compute kernels.

---

## What it is

kernel-skills is a curated collection of `SKILL.md` files. Each file is a structured engineering playbook that an AI coding agent can follow when writing, optimizing, debugging, or porting compute kernels.

This repository is not a runtime, framework, package manager, benchmark harness, or MCP server. It is a library of Markdown files. No installation required. No tooling required. Pick a skill, read it or paste it into your agent workflow, and get better kernel output.

---

## Why it exists

AI coding agents produce substantially worse kernel code when given vague prompts. They skip constraint gathering, choose incorrect tile strategies, ignore boundary conditions, make unsupported performance claims, and produce code that looks plausible but fails on real hardware.

Structured skill files change this. A well-authored skill forces the agent to:

- gather the right constraints before writing a single line of code
- choose the correct algorithm and memory strategy for the workload
- reason explicitly about correctness risks and edge cases
- avoid cargo-cult optimization and fake performance claims
- explain tradeoffs with technical precision
- know when a custom kernel is not the right answer

This repository exists to provide those skill files at expert quality, openly, for any agent and any workflow.

---

## Who it is for

This repository is for engineers who use AI coding agents to work on:

- CUDA kernel development
- Triton kernel development
- Quantized kernels (int8, fp8)
- High performance numerics and AI workloads
- Kernel optimization, debugging, and porting

It is also useful for engineers who want a technical reference for how to approach these problems systematically, independent of any agent.

## How to use a skill

1. Find the skill that matches your task in `skills/`.
2. Open the `SKILL.md` file and paste its full contents into your agent's context.
3. Ask the agent to perform the task.

The skill does not replace your prompt — it forces the agent to reason correctly before writing a single line of code.

### Example (Claude Code)

```
<paste contents of skills/cuda/write-cuda-reduction-kernel/SKILL.md>

Write a warp-shuffle reduction kernel for float32 inputs on an H100.
Input shape: [B=32, N=65536]. Output: [B] row-wise sums.
```

The skill works the same way with ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and any other agent that accepts context.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Before opening a pull request, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The short version: open an issue first to propose the skill scope, follow the required 11-section `SKILL.md` template, meet the quality bar, and keep naming conventions consistent.

Low-quality, vague, or out-of-scope skill files will not be merged regardless of technical domain.

---

## Roadmap

More skills are being added across CUDA, Triton, quantization, and portability. Following the quality-first principle: each skill ships only when it is genuinely better than a generic prompt.

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the full plan.
