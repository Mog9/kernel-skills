# kernel-skills

**kernel-skills** is an open source library of high quality skill files for AI coding agents working on compute kernels.

---

## What it is

kernel-skills is a curated collection of `SKILL.md` files. Each file is a structured engineering playbook that an AI coding agent can follow when writing, optimizing, debugging, or porting compute kernels.

The skills are the product. The repository also ships an npm package (`@krxgu/kernel-skills`) that wraps them in a versioned registry with a small CLI and TypeScript API. Use the npm package if you want to script skill discovery and bundling; otherwise just read or paste the Markdown directly.

## What it is not

- **not a kernel compiler** — it never invokes nvcc, ptxas, or hip-clang
- **not a benchmark harness** — it does not run kernels or measure performance
- **not a model-serving runtime**
- **not an autonomous coding agent**
- **does not execute generated code**

---

## Why it exists

AI coding agents produce substantially worse kernel code when given vague prompts. They skip constraint gathering, choose incorrect tile strategies, ignore boundary conditions, make unsupported performance claims, and produce code that looks plausible but fails on real hardware.

Structured skill files change this. A well-authored skill forces the agent to:

- gather the right constraints before writing a single line of code
- choose the correct algorithm and memory strategy for the workload
- reason explicitly about correctness risks and edge cases
- avoid cargo-cult optimization and fake performance claims
- explain tradeoffs with technical precision
- know when a custom kernel is not the right answer

This repository exists to provide those skill files at expert quality, openly, for any agent and any workflow.

## Measured impact

> Same model. Same prompt. One difference: a kernel skill file.
> The naive softmax kernel fails on overflow and large shapes. The skill-guided version stays correct and bandwidth-competitive.

![Proof of impact — pass/fail heatmap, stat cards, bandwidth chart](proof/cuda/softmax/hero-proof.png)

### Correctness: pass / fail matrix

| Shape N | Naive · normal | Stable · normal | Naive · adversarial | Stable · adversarial |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 64 | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| 128 | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| 256 | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **257** | **❌** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| 512 | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| 1024 | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| 2048 | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| 4096 | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |

Naive adversarial: **8/8 shapes fail** — NaN/Inf output, no max subtraction.  
Naive normal for N > 256: **5/5 shapes fail** — silent wrong output, no strided loop.  
Stable after skill: **0/16 failures**. Bandwidth within 1.2% of `torch.softmax`.

### The two changes the skill directed

## Who it is for

This repository is for engineers who use AI coding agents to work on:

- CUDA kernel development
- Triton kernel development
- Quantized kernels (int8, fp8)
- High performance numerics and AI workloads
- Kernel optimization, debugging, and porting

It is also useful for engineers who want a technical reference for how to approach these problems systematically, independent of any agent.

---

## Installation

Install the package:

```bash
npm install @krxgu/kernel-skills
```

Or run any CLI command without installing:

```bash
npx @krxgu/kernel-skills list
```

You can also clone the repo and use the `SKILL.md` files directly — the npm package is a convenience layer on top of that source of truth.

## CLI

```bash
kernel-skills list
kernel-skills list --category triton
kernel-skills search rmsnorm
kernel-skills show triton.write-triton-layernorm-kernel
kernel-skills path triton.write-triton-layernorm-kernel
kernel-skills bundle triton.write-triton-layernorm-kernel patterns.write-kernel-test-plan
kernel-skills categories
kernel-skills tags
```

## Programmatic usage

```ts
import { searchSkills, getSkill, bundleSkills } from "@krxgu/kernel-skills";

const matches = searchSkills("rmsnorm");

const skill = await getSkill("triton.write-triton-layernorm-kernel");

const bundle = await bundleSkills([
  "triton.write-triton-layernorm-kernel",
  "patterns.write-kernel-test-plan",
]);

console.log(bundle);
```

## How to use a skill

1. Find the skill that matches your task in `skills/`.
2. Open the `SKILL.md` file and paste its full contents into your agent's context.
3. Ask the agent to perform the task.

The skill does not replace your prompt — it forces the agent to reason correctly before writing a single line of code.

### Example (Claude Code)

```
<paste contents of skills/cuda/write-cuda-reduction-kernel/SKILL.md>

Write a warp-shuffle reduction kernel for float32 inputs on an H100.
Input shape: [B=32, N=65536]. Output: [B] row-wise sums.
```

The skill works the same way with ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and any other agent that accepts context.

| Agent | Guide |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | [examples/how-to-use-with-claude-code.md](examples/how-to-use-with-claude-code.md) |
| ChatGPT | [examples/how-to-use-with-chatgpt.md](examples/how-to-use-with-chatgpt.md) |
| Cursor | [examples/how-to-use-with-cursor.md](examples/how-to-use-with-cursor.md) |
| Gemini CLI | [examples/how-to-use-with-gemini-cli.md](examples/how-to-use-with-gemini-cli.md) |

## Skill metadata format

Every skill ships with a `skill.json` next to its `SKILL.md`. Example:

```json
{
  "id": "triton.write-triton-layernorm-kernel",
  "name": "Write Triton LayerNorm Kernel",
  "category": "triton",
  "summary": "Implement LayerNorm in Triton with Welford online variance, persistent kernel pattern, and backward pass accumulation strategy.",
  "tags": ["triton", "layernorm", "normalization", "welford"],
  "difficulty": "intermediate",
  "hardware": ["nvidia", "amd"],
  "languages": ["python", "triton"],
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "entry": "skills/triton/write-triton-layernorm-kernel/SKILL.md"
}
```

The full schema is in [schema/skill.schema.json](schema/skill.schema.json). The build aggregates every `skill.json` into `generated/skills.index.json`, which is what the CLI and programmatic API read from.

Allowed categories: `cuda`, `triton`, `patterns`, `quantization`, `portability`, `inference`.

Allowed difficulty values: `beginner`, `intermediate`, `advanced`.

## Adding a new skill

1. Create `skills/<category>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` following the 11-section template documented in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
2. Create `skills/<category>/<skill-name>/skill.json` with the metadata fields above.
3. Run `npm run validate:skills` to confirm the metadata is well-formed and the `SKILL.md` exists.
4. Run `npm run generate:index` to regenerate `generated/skills.index.json`.
5. Open a pull request.

The validator rejects: missing `skill.json`, missing required fields, duplicate `id`s, unknown categories, mismatched parent folder vs `category`, empty tags arrays, invalid difficulty, unparseable JSON, missing `entry` files, and `SKILL.md` files smaller than 400 bytes.

## Publishing workflow

Before publishing:

```bash
npm install
npm run generate:index
npm run validate:skills
npm run build
npm run test
npm run publish:dry-run
```

Inspect the dry-run output and confirm only `dist/`, `skills/`, `generated/`, `schema/`, `examples/`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `package.json` are included.

First publish (scoped public package):

```bash
npm login
npm publish --access public
```

Subsequent versions:

```bash
npm version patch   # or minor / major
npm publish
```

## Versioning policy

Semantic versioning, applied to package behavior:

- **patch** — typo fixes, metadata fixes, non-breaking skill improvements
- **minor** — new skills, new CLI commands, new API helpers
- **major** — breaking changes to the metadata schema, CLI behavior, or API return types

Each `skill.json` also carries its own `version` field for fine-grained tracking of individual skill revisions.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Before opening a pull request, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The short version: open an issue first to propose the skill scope, follow the required 11-section `SKILL.md` template, meet the quality bar, and keep naming conventions consistent.

Low-quality, vague, or out-of-scope skill files will not be merged regardless of technical domain.

---

## Roadmap

More skills are being added across CUDA, Triton, quantization, and portability. Following the quality-first principle: each skill ships only when it is genuinely better than a generic prompt.

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the full plan.
